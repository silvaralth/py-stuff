# Data Analysis

Data is collected everywhere around us, but data does not mean information. Data analysis (data science), helps us unlock the information and insights from raw data to answer our questions. So data analysis plays an important role by helping us to discover useful information from the data, answer questions, and even predict the future or the unknown.

These are my notes from the IA Specialization to begin looking into some basic insights from the data.

## Vocabulary:

**Dataset** is a file, data collection, sometimes the first row is a header, which contains columns names.

**Target value** or label in other words. Is the value that we want to predict from the dataset and the predictors should be all the other variables listed like symboling, normalized-losses, make, and so on.
